# Coterie

Coterie is a web application that allows users to join and host virtual meetings to connect people with shared interests. The inspiration of this app came during the time of [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) where it's been difficult for people to gather in-person. Coterie provides a safe space to stay connected and continue to meet new people. The definition of *Coterie* is a small group of people with shared interests or tastes.
